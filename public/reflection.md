# Topics that I am good at/know well.

## One). If statements. 
### This topic for me was very easy. It was easy for me to understand because of my grade 8 lectures and grade 7 lectures, so I have a lot of knowledge about the logic used.

## Two). For and While loops. 
### This topic for me was rlly hard because the logic was hard to understand. It was easy to use simply but hard to use complicatedly.

## Three). Functions for me are very easy. 
### This topic is very easy because its basically just like code thats stored into a variable. This concept was very easy for me to grasp because I also learned this in C++.

## Four). Hyperlinking
### Hyper linking was easy for me to understand because it is just a simple concept. It may be a simple line of code, but it has a lot of use when making html pages.

## Five). Variable declaration in java script.
### This topic was very easy for me to understand. There are different types of variables, and each type is unique. Learning variable declarations was easy because you can declare it with somewhat the same as in c++.

# Topics that I'm bad at and need improvement on
## One). Html(The boxes and stuff)
### Using html to make the webpage look better took me a while to get used to. It was hard to know all of the tags that I need to use, and also how to link JS files into my html. I am gonna try to memorize specific tags that I think would be useful, then try to incorporate them into exersices and try them myself to imrpove my html skills.
## Two). Github
### Linking my files to github for me is really hard. I still don't know how to sync my files and commit my changes correctly. I struggle with exersices that involve submitting it by adding it onto the github page. Im trying to fix this by learning github in and out by using youtube tutorials.
## Three). Operators
### Operators are hard for me to understand still. Allthough I've been using operators like + - and && and the ||'s, it still is hard for me to get the logic down. Using these operators in this qarter was more challenging than previous grade levels. I will try to focus on improving my logic everytime I solve an exersice. I should try to make a flow chart so I have a clear view of what my logic should be and how to use my operators.
## Four). Number objects
### It took me sometime to understand each function. I still dont know ALL of the necessary functions that I need. That's why I plan to start applying number fucntions that I haven't used before so I have a higher bag of number functions to pull from.
## Five). Conditional statements
### The logic is very tricky for me. The use of the ! operator specifically is very confusing to use. I dont understand it that much but, I can use it for simple tasks but not for complex tasks. That's why I plan to start trying self practice so I can improve my logic skills not just in conditional statements, but everything coding related.
## Activities in class that helped me.
### The kahoot was a very effective activity done in class, because It helped me remember terms using a fun experience. Because of this I was able to have fun while learning at the same time. 
### I also think that the exersices that were given in class were effective because it helped me put my theoretical skills(like my definitions and everything) to practical use.
## Activities in class that was not very effective in class
### The speed tests for me were not very effective, because I dont do well under time pressure, and it takes me a while to process the logic behind the code.
### N/A(dont have any other innefective activities that are not effective in class)
